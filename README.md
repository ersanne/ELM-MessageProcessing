#### Project info
The program is a simple C# WPF app that takes messages and processes them based on criteria. I.e. textspeak such LOL in SMS messages are expanded to LOL\<Laughing out loud>.
It is meant as a prototype to show the functionality of a service that would do this automatically before distributing the processed message to the appropriate people.

#### Run info
To run simply start the program from Visual Studio/Rider or run the latest build from Project\ELMPrototype\bin\Debug.
More info can be found in run_instructions.txt.
