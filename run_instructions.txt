Running the program:
The program can be started from visual studio or rider and will detect the textspeak file correctly.
Alternatively the latest build can be run from Project\ELMPrototype\bin\Debug.

Using the program:
File input must be .txt and messages must be seperated by "---".
Messages are formated the same way they would be for standard input.
A sample input file is a available at Project/sample_input_file.txt
A sample output file is also available at Project/sample_output.json

When saving the program will always try to create/append to "./output.json".
